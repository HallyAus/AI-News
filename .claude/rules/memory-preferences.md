# Memory: Preferences

> How Daniel likes things done. Claude updates this when preferences are stated.
> Auto-loaded every session via `.claude/rules/`.

## Communication

- Be direct, skip the preamble
- Australian English spelling (colour, organise, etc.)
- Minimal formatting unless explicitly asked for lists/headers

## Code

- [e.g., Prefer type hints / strict types]
- [e.g., Prefer composition over inheritance]
- [e.g., Use named exports]
- [e.g., Comments explain WHY not WHAT]

## Documentation

- Always include Buy Me a Coffee + Starlink links in GitHub READMEs
- Practical over theoretical — show examples
- Keep docs updated as code changes, not as an afterthought

## Workflow

- [e.g., Prefer small focused commits over big ones]
- [e.g., Test-first when writing new features]
- [e.g., Always update HANDOFF.md before session ends]

## Tools

- [e.g., VS Code / NeoVim / Claude Code CLI]
- [e.g., Docker for dev environments]
- [e.g., Git flow / trunk-based development]
